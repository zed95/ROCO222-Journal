2 - Build a DC motor (02/10/2017)
==================================

> ## Building the commutator
> 
> The **commutator** is responsible for reversing the current through the coil when that coil moves through the magnetic field to ensure constant rotation of the motor. A basic commutator is simply two metal plates which will come in contact with positive and negative wires of the power supply while rotationg.
> 
> The first step me and my lab partner Kyle have taken to contruct the commutator was sticking the copper tape around one side the cork.

> 
> Before dividing the copper into two plates, I have decided to first draw a line on the cork to indiciate where we should make the divide. The point of this was to make sure that the lengths of the two plates are approximately the same length.

> ## Adding the support shaft
> 
> The support shaft is usually a metal rod on which the **armature** rests on and spins around its axis. The support shaft we will be using is made up if two metal pins.
> 
> There wasn't much to do in this section, the two pins only needed to be pushed into the middle of the cork from both sides create the shaft.
