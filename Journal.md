> ## Building the commutator

> The **commutator** is responsible for reversing the current through the coil when that coil moves through the magnetic field to ensure constant rotation of the motor. A basic commutator is simply two metal plates which will come in contact with positive and negative wires of the power supply while rotationg.

> The first step me and my lab partner Kyle have taken to contruct the commutator was sticking the copper tape around one side the cork.
