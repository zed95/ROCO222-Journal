2 - Build a DC motor (02/10/2017)
==================================

> ## Building the commutator
> 
> The **commutator** is responsible for reversing the current through the coil when that coil moves through the magnetic field to ensure constant rotation of the motor. A basic commutator is simply two metal plates which will come in contact with positive and negative wires of the power supply while rotationg.
> 
> The first step me and my lab partner Kyle have taken to contruct the commutator was sticking the copper tape around one side the cork.

> 
> Before dividing the copper into two plates, I have decided to first draw a line on the cork to indiciate where we should make the divide. The point of this was to make sure that the lengths of the two plates are approximately the same length.

> ## Adding the support shaft
> 
> The support shaft is usually a metal rod on which the **armature** rests on and spins around its axis. The support shaft we will be using is made up if two metal pins.
> 
> There wasn't much to do in this section, the two pins only needed to be pushed into the middle of the cork from both sides create the shaft.

> ## Winding the armature coil
> 
> The **armature coil** generates a megnetic field when current is passed through it. Combined with magnets, attractive and repulsive forces are generated which make the coil rotate. The coil is created by winding the copper wire around an object.
> 
> Before me and Kyle started winding the copper wire around the cork, we made sure that one end of the wire is sticking out so that it can then be attached to one of the sides of the commutator to allow current to pass through the coil.
> 
> Winding the wire around the cork wasn't easy as the copper wire kept getting tangled, which then had to be untangled which in turn took time and effort. In addition to that, we had to be careful to not damage the commutator in any way. After achieving **150 turns** of wire around the cork, we have sucuessfully created the coil. We made sure that there was enough wire to attach the other end to the other part of the commutator.To secure the coil, we have taped it to the cork using electrical tape. The two ends of the wire had to be sanded down to remove the enamel on the copper which prevented the it wire from conducting electricity. At the end we have measured the total resistance of the coil using a multimeter; the measured value was 7.5&#937;.
